**Project Overview**   This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard using Excel to analyze bike sales data. The analysis focuses on perpective of customers to provide actionable insights that support strategic decision-making. 

**Datasource :**

**Tools:** Microsoft Excel

**Data Cleaning and preprocessing**

Data cleaning is one of the most important aspects of data processing. It involves refining data to improve its quality, ensuring that it is accurate, complete, and in a format suitable for further analysis. The following tasks were performed to clean the raw dataset:

1.Duplicate values were removed from the "ID" column in the dataset.
2.The values in the "Marital Status" column were changed from "M" to "Married" and "S" to "Single." Additionally, the values in the "Gender" column were changed from "M" to "Male" and "F" to "Female" using the find and replace feature in Excel.
3.The data types of the columns "ID," "Children," "Cars," "Age," and "Income" were changed.
4.Blank rows and columns were checked.
5.A new column, "Age Band," was created using the nested IF function.

**Data Analysis**

The main analysis was conducted through pivot tables to visualize key insights.The dashboard includes the following pivot tables:
